How small can you go while keeping the full power and same features of a mk-312 box? :)
Much thanks goes to metafetish and the buttshock project where i got started with the schematics.

To save cost and space, the entire control panel with LCD and mechanical buttons is gone.
The idea is to make a bluetooth app to take control instead.

Another major difference is that instead of a simple bluetooth bridge (HC05) i plopped in a whole new powerfull MCU (ESP32) on top of the original hardware.
The reason is twofold.
- The one thing we cant really replace with the ErosLink Protocol is the MA Knob, which is now replaced by a DigPot controlled by our new MCU.
- Eventually the idea is to tinker around with a new firmware from scratch, not just reuse the ET312 one.
  This Design allows to take full control of the Output Stage in the future.
