NOTE: Schematics+Board are still IN-PROGRESS, i will announce once i am confident enough in them to put them into production myself.

How small can you go while keeping the full power and same (+more) features of a mk-312 box? :)
The answer is about 90x70x35mm, or about 1/8th of the original box.

Much thanks goes to metafetish and the buttshock project where i got started with the schematics.

To save cost and space, the entire control panel with LCD and mechanical buttons had to go.
The idea is to make a bluetooth app to take control instead.

Another major difference is that instead of a simple bluetooth bridge (HC05) i plopped in a whole new powerfull MCU (ESP32) on top of the original hardware.
The reason is twofold.
- The one thing we cant really replace with the ErosLink Protocol is the MA Knob, which is now replaced by a DigPot controlled by our new MCU.
- Eventually the idea is to tinker around with a new firmware from scratch, not just reuse the ET312 one.
  This Design allows to take full control of the Output Stage in the future.

Power will be supplied by 3x 18650 Lithium Cells. 
As of right now i haven't been able to cram in a charging circuit. So for now they are removable and charged in a tabletop charger.
The unintended side effect is that you could keep a spare set of batteries charged.
